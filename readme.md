# BombFinder
An attempt to recreate Minesweeper using pure HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

## Usage
1. TODO: Select difficulty (or use custom dimensions up to 99x99, and bomb number up to 50% saturation) and click "play"
2. Left-click to clear a tile.
3. Right-click to flag a tile as a potential bomb (this will prevent it from being left-clicked until unflagged)
4. Clear all non-bomb tiles to win!

## TODO
* Implement Difficulties - Easy (15x15, 15 bombs), Medium (25x25, 100 bombs), Hard (40x40, 400 bombs)
* Implement some sort of scoring system, likely based on time.
